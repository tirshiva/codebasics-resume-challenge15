Make an end to end python data analysis project Provide Insights to a Business Magazine by Analysing 
the Economic and Social Impact of the IPL.

"Business  Basics"  is  a  business  blogging  company  that  has  established  a  strong 
following  in  the  business  content  space.  Considering  the  negative  sentiment  from 
viewers on the fact that more than 50% of the IPL advertisements are occupied by fantasy 
apps and pan masala ads, they want to release an edition focusing on the dual impact of 
IPL  2025:  its  massive  economic  footprint  and  its  potential  social/health  implications. 
This magazine aims to provide a balanced analysis of how IPL drives economic growth 
while also examining the potential consequences of certain advertising practices during 
the tournament.

Begin  your  analysis  by  referring  to  the  provided  datasets,  you  can  make  these 
datasets more structured and cleaner as required for your analysis.  Please refer

Primary Analysis 
1. What is the total revenue generated by IPL from Central contracts in the year 
2025? List the revenue contributors by %.  
2. What is the health / social risk index for each of the top advertising brands?  
Hint: You need to create this by converting the qualitative data from 
“fact_ipl_advertisers” to a quantitative index. 
3. What is projected CAGR until 2030 for the top 5 companies with a high 
health/social risk index? 
4. Estimate the total population being negatively impacted by these high-risk 
brands (both pan-masala and betting apps).  (Tip: Calculate the total users and 
deduce the % of people negatively impacted, such as losing money, losing their 
livelihood, ending up with health issues, etc.) 
5. List the top 5 celebrities who have been promoting the brands with high social 
risk in 2025 and analyse from the internet (tip: use perplexity) to see if they have 
been promoting similar brands in the last 2 years as well.

minimizing potential negative social impacts.

health concerns while preserving revenue. 
5. Recommend strategies for players to evaluate and select endorsement deals
